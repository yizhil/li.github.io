**Option Implied Volatilities Prediction**

![<small>Option Data Embedded via T-SNE</small>](./images/tsne_3d_1.gif width="28%" border="1")
: - *CISC 6352 Adv Computational Finance*

    The purpose of the project is to find the model among DNN, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Tree that works best on predicting implied volatilities. 
	I work with ~12k option data consisting of roughly 50% call and 50% put, visualize their PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP embeddings.
	Then tune the hyper-parameters for each model by GridSearch and measure the MSE by moneyness. ![<small>**Call/Put in Embedding Space**</small>](./images/Embedded_option_data.png width="30%" border="1")
	Results show that GB is the best implied volatility estimator in feature space for both ITM and OTM options, with a MSE of 0.0055, followed by ET, DNN and KNN. 	
	I repeat the training using ITM/OTM only datasets. All models improve the OTM IV predictions but perform  ![<small>**GB Residual Scatter & Distribution**</small>](./images/residual_GB.png width="30%" border="1")poorerly with ITM options.
	Interestingly, in the embedding dimension, options can be clustered by type at ease while models generally
	have poorer predictability because of the loss of some feature information.

**Bankruptcy Predication via Neural Network**
![<small>Evaluate Effect of Learning Settings</small>](./images/nn_topo.jpg width="28%" border="1")
: - *CISC 5800 Machine Learning*

    We implement a neural network from scratch. The classifier is dependent solely on NumPy and has epoch, learning rate, 
	and neuron structure as hyperparameters. We extend its functionality by incorporating 2 learning techniques, momentum gradient descent and neural pruning, 
	and 2 activation functions, ReLu and tanh. We work with Polish Companies Bankruptcy dataset, test and compare the effects of hyper-parameters and learning 
	method on prediction accuracy and run-time. One major observation suggests that more complicated neuron structure does not always lead to higher accuracy, 
	but does take significantly more time to train. [[code][c2]] [[data][d2]] [[pics][p2]]

**Scalable PDE Solver for Options Pricing**
![<small>Price a Vanilla Option</small>](./images/option.png width="28%" border="1")
: - *QFGB 8960 Advanced C++*
  
    Design, build and implement a PDE solver using 3 finite difference methods (Explicit, Implicit, and Crank-Nicolson). 
	The solver aims to compute value and Greeks for Call/Put, Eur/Ame/Bermuda, Vanilla/Barrier options, a total of 24 type combinations 
	and compare 3 methods. The solver takes great advantage of polymorphimsm and inheritance, and thus can be easily expanded to 
	numerically solve other PDEs or price other option when its payoff provided. [[code][c3]] [[pics][p3]]

**Trump Tweets based Trading Strategy**
![<small>Word Cloud Generated by Tweets</small>](./images/trump.png width="28%" border="1")
: - *QFGB 8954 Research Seminar*
  
    The phenomenan that President Trump announced increased tariff on China and S&P500 index dropped dramatically in the next two days, 
	inspire us to explore the influence Trump has on the market and develop a model to predict the market movement based on the president's words. 
	We collect 8 years tweets starting 2010, visualize with a word cloud, and connect them with S&P500 index to create the dataset. The model 
	trained with Naive Bayes algorithm ends up with a predication accuracy of 54.6% in 2018. Based on this, we devise two trading strategies 
	that outperform the index. [[code][c4]] [[pics][p4]]
